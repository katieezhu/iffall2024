        <p>Spinning out on what to say or what to do<br>
            Finding reasons for my constant change in mood<br>
            Said I'll see it to believe it, but who knows the actual truth?<br>
            'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure<br><br>
            
            'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches<br>
            And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets<br>
            Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in<br>
            'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure<br><br>
            
            Find it hard to say, I know that I'm alright<br>
            Took a while for me to finally realise<br>
            That when I see it, I'll believe it<br>
            Giving me a peace of mind<br>
            I'm sure now, I'm sure<br><br>
            
            'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches<br>
            And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets<br>
            Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in<br>
            'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure<br><br>
            
            'Cause some days, I'm afraid to fall down<br>
            But I understand the coming outcome, pick it up if I allow it<br>
            Can't help it, can't help<br><br>
            
            'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches<br>
            And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets<br>
            Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in<br>
            'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure</p>
