    <h1>Get to know me!</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>My name is Katie. I'm a junior studying Communication Design with minors in HCI and Psychology.</li>

        <br>

    <li>Although I'm required to take this class as part of my major requirements, 
        I have a passion for computer science! My mom first introduced me to CS 
        at a young age as an IT specialist herself. I really want to learn about
        the intersection between design and user experience, so I'm excited to
        parttake in this class!</li>

        <br>

    <li>I have experience with HTML, CSS, Java, and Python! I just did a lot of
        coding as a kid since my mom introduced me to it.</li>

        <br>

    <li>It's been a long time since I've experimented with HTML and especially
        CSS, so I hope to hone my skills in this class.</li>

        <br>

    <li>A lot with designing on paper is about cohesion and catching a user's eye.
        In my opinion, with designing for the screen, it's all about accessibility
        and being able to communicate as quickly as possible. For example, if you 
        want to access all of the pages on a screen, perhaps an accordian button 
        will do.</li>

        <br>

    <li><a href="https://spotify.design/">[https://spotify.design/]</a> I've always admired 
        the design choices and visuals from Spotify's design teams. There's an established color 
        combination along with typographic elements and image manipulation that you can just tell 
        are Spotify.</li>

        <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords">[https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords]</a> 
        The NYT Games page! I do on the page everyday to play these games and I figured the site 
        is very easy to determine what and where you want to go. To play this game? Press play!</li>

        <br>

    <li><a href="https://washu.edu/">[https://washu.edu/]</a> I really like the new WashU website 
        and the entire branding update. It looks so much better than the previous website in terms 
        of just visual aesthetics and just overall is refreshing to look at. The navigation bar and 
        other new elements make it easy to use as well.</li>
